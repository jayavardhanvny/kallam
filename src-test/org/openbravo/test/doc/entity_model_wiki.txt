== Entity Model ==

This page is a reference-card like representation of the entity model. The entity model is used by the [[ERP/2.50/Developers_Guide/Concepts/Data_Access_Layer | Data Access Layer]] and the [[ERP/2.50/Developers_Guide/Concepts/REST_Web_Services | REST webservices]].
This Entity Model reference can be useful when creating HQL queries or when executing REST requests. 
 
The table below shows the entities available in standard Openbravo ERP 2.50. The table shows the following information:
* Entity name: the name of the entity (corresponds to AD_Table.name), this name is globally unique. The entity name links to a page with all properties of that entity.
* Table name: the name of the table modeled by the entity. The table name links through to the database model.
* Class name: the fully qualified java class name implementing this entity. The class name links to the java source code as it is generated by Openbravo.
