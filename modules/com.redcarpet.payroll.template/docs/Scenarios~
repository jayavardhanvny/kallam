#Payroll Scenarios

Case2: No work scenario: when employee is present if there is no work then Present will be checked and no work will be unchecked
so Standard component salary = ((BASIC * 60%)/No of days in month) * (no of days presnet - no work)
incentives = VariableSetLine * (no of days presnet + no work)

Case3: Deducting LateAmount for employee based on Shift typ, its applicable for employees of type WOrkers

for ex:

1st Shift = 10 hrs, Salary = (PerDaySal/(60* Shift Time in Hours)) * Late Time in Mins
2nd Shift = 8 hrs, Salary = (PerDaySal/(60* Shift Time in Hours)) * Late Time in Mins
3rd Shift = 6 hrs, Salary = (PerDaySal/(60* Shift Time in Hours)) * Late Time in Mins
